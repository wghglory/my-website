excerpt: caveats for conditional types and infer
---

```ts
type Flatten<T> = T extends any[] ? T[number] : T;

// Extracts out the element type.
type Str = Flatten<string[]>; // type Str = string;

// Leaves the type alone.
type Num = Flatten<number>; // type Num = number;
```

## Inferring Within Conditional Types

Conditional types provide us with a way to infer from types we compare against in the true branch using the infer
keyword. For example, we could have inferred the element type in Flatten instead of fetching it out “manually” with an
indexed access type:

```ts
type Flatten<Type> = Type extends Array<infer Item> ? Item : Type;
```

Here, we used the `infer` keyword to declaratively **introduce a new generic type variable named `Item`** instead of
specifying how to retrieve the element type of T within the true branch. This frees us from having to think about how to
dig through and probing apart the structure of the types we’re interested in.

We can write some useful helper type aliases using the `infer` keyword. For example, for simple cases, we can extract
the return type out from function types:

```ts
type GetReturnType<Type> = Type extends (...args: never[]) => infer Return ? Return : never;

type Num = GetReturnType<() => number>; // type Num = number

type Str = GetReturnType<(x: string) => string>; // type Str = string

type Bools = GetReturnType<(a: boolean, b: boolean) => boolean[]>; // type Bools = boolean[]
```

When inferring from a type with multiple call signatures (such as the type of an overloaded function), inferences are
made from the last signature (which, presumably, is the most permissive catch-all case). It is not possible to perform
overload resolution based on a list of argument types.

```ts
declare function stringOrNum(x: string): number;
declare function stringOrNum(x: number): string;
declare function stringOrNum(x: string | number): string | number;

type T1 = ReturnType<typeof stringOrNum>;
// type T1 = string | number
```

## Distributive Conditional Types

When conditional types act on a generic type, they become distributive when given a union type. For example, take the
following:

If we plug a union type into ToArray, then the conditional type will be applied to each member of that union.

```ts
type ToArray<Type> = Type extends any ? Type[] : never;

type StrArrOrNumArr = ToArray<string | number>;

// type StrArrOrNumArr = string[] | number[]
```

What happens here is that StrArrOrNumArr distributes on: `string | number;`

and maps over each member type of the union, to what is effectively: `ToArray<string> | ToArray<number>;`

which leaves us with: `string[] | number[];`

Typically, distributivity is the desired behavior. To avoid that behavior, you can surround each side of the extends
keyword with square brackets.

```ts
type ToArrayNonDist<Type> = [Type] extends [any] ? Type[] : never;

// 'StrArrOrNumArr' is no longer a union.
type StrArrOrNumArr = ToArrayNonDist<string | number>;
// type StrArrOrNumArr = (string | number)[]
```
