## Service-based Architecture

**Service-based architecture is a hybrid of the microservices architecture style** and is considered one of the most
pragmatic architecture styles, mostly due to its architectural flexibility. Although service-based architecture is a
**distributed architecture**, it doesn’t have the same level of complexity and cost as other distributed architectures.

## Topology

In most cases, there is only a single instance of each domain service within a service-based architecture. However, based
on scalability, fault tolerance, and throughput needs, multiple instances of a domain service can certainly exist.

### Database variants

Similarly, opportunities may exist to break apart a single monolithic database into separate databases, even going as
far as domain-scoped databases matching each domain service (similar to microservices). In these cases, it is important
to make sure the data in each separate database is not needed by another domain service.

## Characteristics

Because domain services are coarse-grained, regular ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) database
transactions involving database commits and rollbacks are used to ensure database integrity within a single domain
service. Highly distributed architectures like microservices, on the other hand, usually have fine-grained services and
use a distributed transaction technique known as BASE transactions (basic availability, soft state, eventual
consistency) that rely on eventual consistency and hence do not support the same level of database integrity as ACID
transactions in a service-based architecture.

To illustrate this point, consider the example of a catalog checkout process within a service-based architecture.
Suppose the customer places an order and the credit card used for payment has expired. Since this is an atomic
transaction within the same service, everything added to the database can be removed using a rollback and a notice sent
to the customer stating that the payment cannot be applied. Now consider this same process in a microservices
architecture with smaller fine-grained services.

First, the OrderPlacement service would accept the request, create the order, generate an order ID, and insert the order
into the order tables. Once this is done, the order service would then make a remote call to the PaymentService, which
would try to apply the payment. If the payment cannot be applied due to an expired credit card, then the order cannot be
placed and the data is in an inconsistent state (the order information has already been inserted but has not been
approved). In this case, what about the inventory for that order? Should it be marked as ordered and decremented? What
if the inventory is low and another customer wishes to purchase the item? Should that new customer be allowed to buy it,
or should the reserved inventory be reserved for the customer trying to place the order with an expired credit card?
These are just a few of the questions that would need to be addressed when orchestrating a business process with
multiple finer-grained services.

Domain services, being coarse-grained, allow for better data integrity and consistency, but there is a trade-off. With
service-based architecture, a change made to the order placement functionality in the OrderService would require testing
the entire coarse-grained service (including payment processing), whereas with microservices the same change would only
impact a small OrderPlacement service (requiring no change to the PaymentService). Furthermore, because more code is
being deployed, there is more risk with service-based architecture that something might break (including payment
processing), whereas with microservices each service has a single responsibility, hence less chance of breaking other
functionality when being changed.

## Database Partitioning

Although not required, services within a service-based architecture **usually share a single, monolithic database** due
to the small number of services (4 to 12) within a given application context. <u>This database coupling can present an
issue with respect to database table schema changes. If not done properly, a table schema change can potentially impact
every service</u>, making database changes a very costly task in terms of effort and coordination.

The practice of creating a single shared library of entity objects is the least effective way of implementing
service-based architecture. Any change to the database table structures would also require a change to the single shared
library containing all of the corresponding entity objects, thus requiring a change and redeployment to every service.

> One way to mitigate the impact and risk of database changes is to logically partition the database and manifest the
> logical partitioning through federated shared libraries.

Service-based architecture is a domain-partitioned architecture, meaning that the structure is driven by the domain
rather than a technical consideration.
