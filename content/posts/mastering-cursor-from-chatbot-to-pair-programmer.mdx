This guide outlines the shift from treating AI as a snippet generator to using it as a fully integrated Junior
Developer.

## 🧠 Phase 1: The Philosophy

### The Mindset Shift

- ❌ **The Old Way:** Treating AI as a "Chatbot" (Copy/Paste from ChatGPT).
- ✅ **The Cursor Way:** Treating AI as a **Junior Developer** living inside your VS Code.
  - **It has Eyes:** It sees your file structure, active tabs, and terminal.
  - **It has Hands:** It can edit, create, and delete files.

> ⭐️ Golden Rule: The AI is only as smart as the Context you give it.
>
> - **No Context** = It guesses (Risk of hallucinations).
> - **Tagged Context** = It acts like a Senior Engineer.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: The Core Toolkit (Daily Drivers)

Before diving deep, master the three primary interaction points.

### 1. Tab (Copilot++)

**What it is:** Auto-logic, not just auto-complete. It predicts your next cursor position and the next few lines of
code.

- **Usage:** Start typing. If the gray text looks right, hit `Tab`.
- **Partial Accept:** Hold `Ctrl` (or `Cmd`) + `Right Arrow` to accept word-by-word.
- **Jump Navigation:** If Cursor suggests a change in a different file (e.g., updating an import), hitting `Tab` will
  physically move you to that file.

### 2. Inline Edit (`Cmd + K` / `Ctrl + K`)

**What it is:** Quick, localized edits without opening the chat sidebar.

- **Workflow:** Highlight code → Press `Cmd + K` → Type instruction.
- **Use Cases:** "Add error handling," "Convert to async/await," "Fix typo."

### 3. Modes

Cursor has distinct modes for different stages of development.

| Mode  | Best Used For                  | Capabilities                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent | Building features, refactoring | Autonomous exploration, multi-file edits, terminal usage.     |
| Ask   | Learning & questions           | Read-only exploration. No file changes.                       |
| Plan  | Architecture & Strategy        | Creates implementation plans before coding.                   |
| Debug | Tricky bugs                    | Hypothesis generation, log instrumentation, runtime analysis. |

## 🧠 Phase 3: Context Mastery

The most powerful feature of Cursor is explicit context tagging using the `@` symbol.

### The `@` Symbol

| Tag                | Purpose            | Best Use Case                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @Files and Folders | Specific Files     | Reference `@user.service.ts` to focus the AI.                 |
| @Docs              | Live Documentation | Paste a URL (e.g., Next.js 15) to overcome knowledge cutoffs. |
| @Browser           | Internet Search    | "What is the latest breaking change in React 19?"             |
| @Branch            | Version Control    | "Analyze the diff between this branch and main."              |

> 💡 Context Tip: You don't need to manually tag every file. If you know the exact file, tag it. If not, let the agent
> find it. Over-tagging with irrelevant files can confuse the AI.

## 🗺️ Phase 4: Planning & Design

The most impactful change you can make is planning **before** coding.

### Plan Mode (`Shift + Tab`)

Toggle Plan Mode in the agent input. Instead of writing code immediately, the Agent will:

1. Research your codebase.
2. Ask clarifying questions.
3. Create a Markdown plan with file paths.
4. Wait for approval before building.

> 💡 Click "Save to workspace" to store plans in `.cursor/plans/`. This creates documentation for your team, makes it
> easy to resume interrupted work, and provides context for future agents working on the same feature.

### Design to Code

The agent can process images directly.

- **Workflow:** Drag a screenshot or design file into the chat.
- **Prompt:** "Implement this UI using our existing `@buttons.component.ts` and Tailwind colors."

## ⚙️ Phase 5: Project Configuration (Rules)

Move away from generic prompt engineering. Force the AI to follow your team's style guide automatically.

### How to Set Up

1. Create a folder in root: `.cursor/rules/`
2. Create rule files (e.g., `angular-standards.mdc`).

### Example Rule (`.cursor/rules/angular-standards.mdc`)

```markdown
---
description: Standards for Angular Components
globs: '*/.ts'
---

# Angular Standards

- Use **Signals** for state.
- Use `@if` syntax, not `*ngIf`.
```

### Best Practices for Rules

- **Keep it brief:** Under 500 lines.
- **Use Globs:** Ensure rules only load for relevant files (`*/*.ts` vs `*/*.py`).
- **No Fluff:** Don't document generic things (the AI knows Python). Focus on _your_ specific patterns.
- **Reference Files:** Instead of pasting large code blocks, refer to canonical examples in your codebase.

Keep rules focused on the essentials: the commands to run, the patterns to follow, and pointers to canonical examples in
your codebase. Reference files instead of copying their contents; this keeps rules short and prevents them from becoming
stale as code changes.

What to avoid in rules:

- Copying entire style guides (use a linter instead)
- Documenting every possible command (the agent knows common tools)
- Adding instructions for edge cases that rarely apply

> Tip: Start simple. Add rules only when you notice the agent making the same mistake repeatedly. Don't over-optimize
> before you understand your patterns.

> Check your rules into git so your whole team benefits. When you see the agent make a mistake, update the rule. You can
> even tag `@cursor` on a GitHub issue or PR to have the agent update the rule for you.

## 🚀 Phase 6: Advanced Workflows

Once you have the basics, use these workflows to speed up complex tasks.

### 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Agents perform best when they have a clear target (a failing test) to iterate against.

1. **Write Tests:** "Write a test for `auth.ts` covering the logout edge case. Do not implement the logic yet."
2. **Confirm Failure:** Run the test to ensure it fails.
3. **Implement:** "Write the code to pass the test. Do not modify the test file."
4. **Refactor:** Once green, ask the agent to optimize.

### 🐛 Debug Mode

When standard chat fails, toggle **Debug Mode**.

- It generates hypotheses.
- It adds logging statements automatically.
- It analyzes runtime data to pinpoint root causes.
- It makes targeted fixes based on evidence

### 🤖 Custom Commands

Store frequent workflows in `.cursor/commands/`.

**Example: The `/pr` Command**

> Prompt: "Look at staged changes. Write a commit message. Push to current branch. Use gh pr create to open a pull
> request with a summary."

Commands are ideal for workflows you run many times per day. Store them as Markdown files in `.cursor/commands/` and
check them into git so your whole team can use them.

Other examples of commands we use:

- `/fix-issue [number]`: Fetch issue details with `gh issue view`, find relevant code, implement a fix, and open a PR
- `/review`: Run linters, check for common issues, and summarize what might need attention
- `/update-deps`: Check for outdated dependencies and update them one by one, running tests after each

The agent can use these commands autonomously, so you can delegate multi-step workflows with a single `/` invocation.

## 🤝 Phase 7: Team Collaboration

### **Architecture diagrams**

For significant changes, ask the agent to generate architecture diagrams. Try prompting: "Create a Mermaid diagram
showing the data flow for our authentication system, including OAuth providers, session management, and token refresh."
These diagrams are useful for documentation and can reveal architectural issues before code review.

### **Speeding Up Pull Requests**

Stop writing manual descriptions.

1. Stage your changes (`git add .`).
2. Prompt: _"@Branch(Diff with Main) Write a PR description including Summary, Breaking Changes, and Testing
   Instructions."_

### **The "Auto-Reviewer" (Self-Correction)**

Before pushing code, run your own code review.

1. Prompt: _"@Branch(Diff) Review my staged changes. Look for memory leaks, console.logs, and adherence to project
   rules."_

### Code Review

AI-generated code requires _more_ review, not less.

1. **Agent Review:** Click `Review` → `Find Issues` to have the AI critique its own work before you see it.
2. **Self-Correction:** Before pushing, prompt: _"@Branch(Diff) Review my staged changes. Look for memory leaks and
   console.logs."_
3. **Architecture Diagrams:** For big changes, ask: _"Create a Mermaid diagram showing the data flow for our new auth
   system."_

### **Bugbot for pull requests**

Push to source control to get automated reviews on pull requests. Bugbot applies advanced analysis to catch issues early
and suggest improvements on every PR.

### Onboarding

New to a codebase? Use Cursor to ramp up.

- _"How does logging work in this project?"_
- _"Why are we calling **`setUser()`** instead of **`createUser()`** on line 1738?"_

## ⚡ Phase 8: Quick Recipes

Copy-paste these prompt patterns for immediate results.

| Role     | Task         | Prompt Recipe                                                                         |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI Dev   | Clone UI     | Screenshot table → _"Recreate this UI using our existing **`@buttons`** component."_  |
| Backend  | Refactor SQL | Highlight SQL → _"Convert to TypeORM query builder. Ensure injection protection."_    |
| QA       | Unit Tests   | Open file → _"@Codebase Write a test that fails when API returns 500."_               |
| Migrator | Update Libs  | _"@Web What are the breaking changes in Lucide v0.4? Update icons in **`@folder`**."_ |

## 🏆 Habits of Power Users: **Developing your workflow**

The developers who get the most from agents share a few traits:

**They write specific prompts.** The agent's success rate improves significantly with specific instructions. Compare
"add tests for auth.ts" with "Write a test case for auth.ts covering the logout edge case, using the patterns in
`__tests__/` and avoiding mocks."

**They iterate on their setup.** Start simple. Add rules only when you notice the agent making the same mistake
repeatedly. Add commands only after you've figured out a workflow you want to repeat. Don't over-optimize before you
understand your patterns.

**They review carefully.** AI-generated code can look right while being subtly wrong. Read the diffs and carefully
review. The faster the agent works, the more important your review process becomes.

**They provide verifiable goals.** Agents can't fix what they don't know about. Use typed languages, configure linters,
and write tests. Give the agent clear signals for whether changes are correct.

**They treat agents as capable collaborators.** Ask for plans. Request explanations. Push back on approaches you don't
like.
