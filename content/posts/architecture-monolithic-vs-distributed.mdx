## Monolithic vs Distributed Architectures

Monolithic:

- Layered architecture
- Pipeline architecture
- Microkernel architecture

Distributed:

- Service-based architecture
- Event-driven architecture
- Space-based architecture
- Service-oriented architecture
- Microservice architecture

### Fallacy 1: The network is reliable

Service A makes a request to Service B to process some data and does not receive a response because of a network issue.
This is why things like timeouts and circuit breakers exist between services. The more a system relies on the network
(such as microservices architecture), the potentially less reliable it becomes.

### Fallacy 2: Latency Is Zero

Ask yourself this question: do you know what the average round-trip latency is for a RESTful call in your production
environment? Is it 60 milliseconds? Is it 500 milliseconds? When using any distributed architecture, architects must
know this latency average. It is the only way of determining whether a distributed architecture is feasible,
particularly when considering microservices.

Assuming an average of 100 milliseconds of latency per request, chaining together 10 service calls to perform a
particular business function adds 1,000 milliseconds to the request!

### Fallacy 3: Bandwidth Is Infinite

Bandwidth is usually not a concern in monolithic architectures, because once processing goes into a monolith, little or
no bandwidth is required to process that business request. However, as shown in Figure 9-4, once systems are broken
apart into smaller deployment units (services) in a distributed architecture such as microservices, communication to and
between these services significantly utilizes bandwidth, causing networks to slow down, thus impacting latency (fallacy
#2) and reliability (fallacy #1).

Assume one wishlist service needs to call another profile service to get customer names. The customer profile service
returns 45 attributes totaling 500 kb to the wish list service, which only needs the name (200 bytes). This is a form of
coupling referred to as **stamp coupling**. This may not sound significant, but requests for the wish list items happen
about 2,000 times a second. This means that this interservice call from the wish list service to the customer profile
service happens 2,000 times a second. At 500 kb for each request, the amount of bandwidth used for that one interservice
call (out of hundreds being made that second) is 1 Gb!

Stamp coupling in distributed architectures consumes significant amounts of bandwidth. If the customer profile service
were to only pass back the data needed by the wish list service (in this case 200 bytes), the total bandwidth used to
transmit the data is only 400 kb. Stamp coupling can be resolved in the following ways:

- Create private RESTful API endpoints
- Use field selectors in the contract
- Use GraphQL to decouple contracts
- Use value-driven contracts with consumer-driven contracts (CDCs)
- Use internal messaging endpoints

### Fallacy 4: The Network Is Secure

Security becomes much more challenging in a distributed architecture. Each endpoint to each distributed deployment unit
must be secured so that unknown or bad requests do not make it to that service.

### Fallacy 5: The Topology Never Changes

Architects must be in constant communication with operations and network administrators to know what is changing and
when so that they can make adjustments accordingly to reduce surprises.

### Fallacy 6: There Is Only One Administrator

There are dozens of network administrators in a typical large company, especially when you're working with distributed
architectures.

### Fallacy 7: Transport Cost Is Zero

Distributed architectures cost significantly more than monolithic architectures, primarily due to increased needs for
additional hardware, servers, gateways, firewalls, new subnets, proxies, and so on.

Whenever embarking on a distributed architecture, we encourage architects to analyze the current server and network
topology with regard to capacity, bandwidth, latency, and security zones to not get caught up in the trap of surprise
with this fallacy.

### Fallacy 8: The Network Is Homogeneous

Most architects and developers assume a network is homogeneous—made up of only one network hardware vendor. Nothing
could be farther from the truth. Most companies have multiple network hardware vendors in their infrastructure, if not
more.

## Other Distributed Considerations

- Distributed logging

- Distributed transactions: Transactional sagas, BASE transactions, which stands for (B)asic availability, (S)oft state,
  and (E)ventual consistency

- Contract maintenance and versioning
