## MicroKernel Architecture

Also known as plugin architecture. In VMware, vCD, as a core system, provides many plugins such as OSE and ALP. Some IDEs like
VS Code and Eclipse provide a core system and plugins. Payment processing could be another example. Chrome and Firefox are
other common product examples. Suppose Payment Processing is the domain service representing the core system. Each
payment method (credit card, PayPal, store credit, gift card, and purchase order) would be separate plugin components
specific to the payment domain.

### Topology

The microkernel architecture style is a relatively simple monolithic architecture consisting of two architecture
components: a core system and many plugin components. Application logic is divided between independent plugin components
and the basic core system, providing extensibility, adaptability, and isolation of application features and custom
processing logic.

### Characteristics

Ideally, plugin components should be independent of each other and have no dependencies between them.

The communication between the plugin components and the core system is generally **point-to-point**, meaning the “pipe”
that connects the plugin to the core system is usually a method invocation or function call to the entry-point class of
the plugin component. In addition, the plugin component can be either **compile-based** or **runtime-based**. <u>Runtime
plugin components can be added or removed at runtime without having to redeploy the core system or other plugins</u>,
and they are usually managed through frameworks such as Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) for Java, Penrose (Java),
Jigsaw (Java), or Prism (.NET). Compile-based plugin components are much simpler to manage but require the entire
monolithic application to be redeployed when modified, added, or removed.

Point-to-point plugin components can be implemented as shared libraries (such as a JAR, DLL, or Gem).

Plug-in components do not always have to be point-to-point communication with the core system. Other alternatives exist,
including using REST or messaging as a means to invoke plug-in functionality, with each plug-in being a standalone
service.

It is not a common practice for plug-in components to connect directly to a centrally shared database. That said,
plug-ins can have their own separate data stores only accessible to that plug-in.

## Architecture Characteristics Ratings

- Deployability : 3
- Elasticity : 1
- Evolutionary : 3
- Fault tolerance : 1
- Modularity : 3
- Overall Cost : 5 (cheap)
- Performance : 3
- Reliability : 3
- Scalability : 1
- Simplicity : 4
- Testability : 3

The microkernel architecture style is unique in that it is the only architecture style that can be both domain
partitioned and technically partitioned. While most microkernel architectures are technically partitioned, the domain
partitioning aspect comes about mostly through a strong domain-to-architecture isomorphism.

Testability, deployability, and reliability rate a little above average (three stars), primarily because functionality
can be isolated to independent plug-in components.

Regarding performance, microkernel applications are generally small and don't grow as large as most layered
architectures. Also, they don't suffer as much from the architecture sinkhole antipattern discussed in Chapter 10.
Finally, microkernel architectures can be streamlined by unplugging unneeded functionality, making the
application run faster.
