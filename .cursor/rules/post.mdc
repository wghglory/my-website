# Rule: Create New Blog Post

## Context

When asked to create a new post, generate a `.mdx` file located in the `content/posts` directory.

## File Naming Convention

- Convert the provided title to kebab-case (e.g., "Framer Motion Examples" -> `framer-motion-examples.mdx`).

## Content Structure

Every post must start with the following YAML Frontmatter based on `a-temp.mdx.tmpl`. Do not omit any fields.

```yaml
---
title: <Title of the post>
topics:
  - <Topic 1>
  - <Topic 2>
date: <Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format>
excerpt: <A concise summary of the post content>
cover:
  banner: <A relevant, high-quality public image URL>
  topic: <Primary Topic>
  title: <Main Title or Shortened Title>
  subtitle: <Subtitle or Hook>
---
## Body

## References
```

## Generation Guidelines

- Date: Always use the current date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- Topics: Infer relevant technical tags based on the prompt content. All availabe topics are defined in
  /models/index.ts's TopicType. You can add new topics if not existing.
- Cover Image (Banner): Search for a relevant, high-quality image URL related to the topic (e.g., from Unsplash or a
  consistent placeholder service like https://placehold.co/600x400?text=Topic). Do not leave this blank.

Cover Metadata:

- cover.topic: Matches the primary topic from the topics list.
- cover.title: usually matches the main title.
- cover.subtitle: A short, catchy sub-header relevant to the post.

Table Generation using below syntax instead of markdown table:

```
<Table
  columns={['Feature', '`Partial<T>`', '`Sparse<T>`']}
  data={[
    ['Top Level Properties', 'Optional', 'Optional'],
    ['Nested Objects', 'Required (Must be complete)', 'Optional (Can be partial)'],
    ['Use Case', 'Simple object creation', 'Patches, deep updates, large forms'],
  ]}
/>
```
